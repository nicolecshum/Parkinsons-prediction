Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by worsening motor and non-motor symptoms, driven by complex pathophysiological processes including abnormal protein aggregation. Current treatments primarily manage symptoms, highlighting a critical need for therapies that can slow disease progression. This study investigates the potential of protein abundance as a predictive biomarker for PD progression, leveraging machine learning techniques on clinical and proteomic data from the Accelerating Medicines PartnershipÂ® Parkinson's Disease (AMP-PD) initiative. We utilized a dataset comprising Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and normalized protein expression (NPX) values for 248 PD patients. Exploratory data analysis revealed varying patterns in UPDRS scores across disease stages and identified several proteins significantly correlated with different symptom domains, implicating roles for vascular function, synaptic regulation, energy metabolism, and immune response. A predictive modeling pipeline was established, using supervised regression models (linear regression and CatBoost) to forecast UPDRS scores at 6, 12, and 18 months. Through rigorous model comparison and hyperparameter tuning, a CatBoost model with optimized parameters consistently demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and highest R2 across most UPDRS subscales and timepoints. While the models showed promise in capturing overall disease progression trends, challenges remain, particularly in predicting scores at the extremes of the UPDRS scale. This study underscores the feasibility of using protein abundance with machine learning to predict PD progression, offering a robust starting point for future research aimed at developing targeted therapies and enhancing our understanding of this complex disease.
